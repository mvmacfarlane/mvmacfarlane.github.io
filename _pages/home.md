### Welcome!

I work on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Search, focusing on optimization and control problems. My research revolves around improving the theoretical and practical aspects of reinforcement learning, developing new algorithms for combinatorial optimization, and improving performance in a wide variety of complex decision-making tasks. My work spans across several fields, including multi-task learning and neural architecture optimization.

The primary aim of my research is to advance the state of AI by building mathematical models and systems that push the boundaries of what reinforcement learning can achieve in practical scenarios.

### About me

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Herke van Hoof within the AMlab group. I hold a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence from the University of St Andrews, where I graduated with distinction, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics with Economics from the London School of Economics.

In addition to my academic work, I have gained practical experience through internships in machine learning and artificial intelligence, working with companies such as InstaDeep on scalable AI solutions. My work has been accepted at top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS and ICML.
